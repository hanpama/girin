> Enumeration types
Also called Enums, enumeration types are a special kind of scalar that is restricted to a particular set of allowed values. This allows you to:
> 1. Validate that any arguments of this type are one of the allowed values
> 2. Communicate through the type system that a field will always be one of a finite set of values
